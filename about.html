		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
	I have been a Special Education Teacher for 7 years! I moved to Utah from Oregon for family and to find more things to do! I have
	a wife who is also a teacher and a 2 1/2 year old and another boy on the way! I am excited for the opportunity to learn something
	new and to start a new career!
